In 2018, the Republicans out raised the Democrats by nearly twenty million dollars. The total
number of contributions to Republicans was 43,515,565.57 while Democrats raised a mere
23,306,769.95 in comparison.

Most of the donors came from California, New York, Florda and Texas. Those states account for
nearly 44% of all donations going to both political parties. California has the highest concentration
of Republican spending, coming from wealthy executives and Silicon Valley moguls such as Peter
Thiel.
CEOâ€™s gave disproportionately to Republicans, with 79% of CEO political donations going to the
RNC. Some interesting donor employers of republicans include MSG, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
and Citadel Investment Group. While prominent democrat employers include Soros Fund
Management, Renaissance Technologies and Schooner Capital.
