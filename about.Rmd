  Hi my name is Benno and I am a journalism minor at the GW School of Media and Public Affairs. Interstingly, I have little interest in becoming a journalist as a career, but nonetheless I have enjoyed the subject and the way it has made me think about the world and writing. The most recent class I took, Reporting in a Digital Age is really interesting.
